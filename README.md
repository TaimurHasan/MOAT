# MOAT
A custom rental property management solution, which allows a property manager to create a platform for their tenants to communicate upwards. A landlord is able to establish their buildings and provide tenants with access to just the building or property they are a part of. The tenant is able to create an account to begin posting maintenance issues, ratings, and communicate with the landlord.
